# My custom QMK keymaps

## Base Layout

I'm typing English and German, this means all layouts will suck in someway. [Hands Down](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown/home/hands-down-neu#h.78qav8n932m7) sucked the less so I took it.

Magic Sturdy also felt pretty ok but I have no clue how to implement it in [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/) and as I'd like to gove the Glove 80 a try a ketymap that does not work on zmk is out of the question. ;/

### Antecedent-morph

[This branch](https://github.com/voidyourwarranty2/zmk/tree/devel-adaptive) implements a feature called `antecedent-morph` that I could use for the magic sturdy layout on the glove?

## TOTEM

Nice, a bit to small

## Redox

Nice, a bit to bulky.
